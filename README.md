# Advent of Code 2021
This is my first AoC, and I'm excited to participate. I look forward to further developing my programming skills during this event. I want to not use formulas found online if formulas are needed. I will allow myself to look up documentation (like `fs` in JavaScript) and examples of the like, but I want to come up with the logic and actual programming bit myself.
### I need to come back to...
* Day 1 - Part 2 (C++) - workaround to avoid out of bounds exception should be fixed
### In the future I'd like to...
* Package all of this into a website

### Things I've learned so far...
* Reading files in JavaScript and C++
* Reintroduction to C++

### Files that need to be converted to C++...
